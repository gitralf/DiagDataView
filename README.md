# DiagDataView
analyze diag data with powershell

showevents.ps1: needs powershell module for Get-DiagnosticData. Allows fine-granular analysis of (Windows) daignostic events from starttime to endtime.

analyze-ddv.ps1: No module required. Export (base) diagnostic events from Diagnostic Data Viewer to CSV and import into script: 

      analyze-ddv.ps1 -inputfile bla.csv
      
Todo:

* check the main part of the events (currently only payload is checked)
* include privTags in report
* make table sortable by clicking on table header
* map events to category even in DDV export (where does the category come from?)
* include office events
  * is there a direct (powershell?) access to Office diagnostic data or only via DDV?  
  * Where to get a (json) file with Office diag events? Website only?

Files:

| analyze-ddv.ps1 | takes a CSV file as input generated by DDV, default limit last 1000 events |
| showevents.ps1 | needs PowerSHell module for Diagnostic Data, ready diagnostic data events between start and endtime |
| events.json | generated by convert-mdwin.ps1, contains all Windows base events and description in json (a little manual editing was necessary) |
| snippets | contains various parts for testing only |
